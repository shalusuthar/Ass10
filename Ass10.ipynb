    "Q1.What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Multithreading is a stringing procedure in Python programming to run various strings simultaneously by quickly exchanging between strings with a central processor help (called setting exchanging). In addition, it makes it possible to share its data space with the primary threads of a process, making it easier than with individual processes to share information and communicate with other threads. The goal of multithreading is to complete multiple tasks at the same time, which improves application rendering and performance.\n",
    "Threading module is used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python multithreading enables efficient utilization of the resources as the threads share the data space and memory. Multithreading in Python allows the concurrent and parallel occurrence of various tasks. It causes a reduction in time consumption or response time, thereby increasing the performance."
